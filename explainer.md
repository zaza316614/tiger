# ALPHA Subnet 107 – Verifiable On-Chain Treasury Data via Decentralized AI

ALPHA is a TAO subnet delivering real-time, verifiable crypto market data through decentralized AI research agents.

Agents continuously source, validate, and publish live price feeds and holdings data—anchored on-chain for treasury managers, analysts, and protocol developers.

## **🌍 Vision: Verifiable Intelligence for a Crypto-Native World**

The future of finance is autonomous. But autonomy without auditability is dangerous.

ALPHA brings together two critical forces:

* AI – For intelligence at scale: parsing filings, scanning chains, ingesting global market signals. 

* Crypto – For trust without centralization: publishing data verifiably, with transparent incentives. 

In a world where opaque models make consequential decisions, we don’t just ask: “what’s the output?”

We ask: “can it be proven?”

ALPHA is designed to be:

* A decentralized research network of real-time agents
* A verifiable oracle layer for crypto data
* A system where data is sourced, not claimed—then verified, not trusted


---


## **⚙️ System Architecture**

* Miners (Agents):

    * Source data from public APIs, blockchains, disclosures, global markets
    * Track prices, wallet balances, supply shifts, and holdings
    * Add new sources (e.g., Japanese ETF flows, Australian exchange rates)

* Validators:

    * Query and cross-score agents’ outputs for accuracy and timeliness
    * Provide final consensus-backed datasets to downstream consumers
    * Stake-enabled to secure validation incentives and quality control

* Subnet Owner:
    * Maintains agent task logic and validation criteria
    * Manages roadmap, codebase, and reward configuration


---


## **🧠 What ALPHA Agents Do**



* Track real-time price data across top exchanges
* Monitor top-10 crypto asset supply and wallet concentration
* Parse filings (e.g., SEC 10-Ks) for corporate BTC/ETH holdings
* Watch treasury balances of private & public companies, DAOs, DeFi protocols, and stablecoins
* Add global context (e.g., ETF flows, stock-to-crypto movements)

---


## **📊 Use Cases**


### **🏦 1. Crypto Treasury Intelligence**



* Agents track BTC holdings of companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, Coinbase

* Data is aggregated into mNAV ratios (market cap vs. on-chain asset value)

* Useful for fund managers, DAO governance, or synthetic exposure tracking



### **🌐 2. Global Market Context**



* Miner adds Japanese ETF BTC flow data

* Agent logs inflow → updates BTC ownership models

* DAO sees regional demand shift → adjusts treasury strategy



### **🧾 3. Real-Time On-Chain Reports**



* Agents monitor USDT issuance and distribution

* Track largest wallet balances + velocity changes

* Daily dashboards provide macro-stablecoin risk snapshots



### **📈 4. Price Feeds and Market Movement Signals**



* Multi-source aggregation of BTC, ETH, SOL prices

* Filter out anomalies, latency spikes, and stale data

* Provide clean real-time feeds for autonomous traders, bots, dashboards, or risk models

## **🔐 Why Verifiable AI Matters**


“Don’t trust, verify.”


AI can generate intelligence. But without verification, that intelligence is just another black box.


In crypto, verification is the norm—blockchains validate every transaction, every block.


AI should be held to the same standard. Especially in finance, where bad data can cost.


ALPHA makes AI agents verifiable by design. Every output is:


* Timestamped on-chain via weight submission

* Sourced from a specific miner (agent)

* Scored by independent validators

* Persisted as a public, auditable dataset

This turns AI-sourced information into a decentralized oracle layer for crypto.


No trusted server, no hidden model, no unverifiable claim.


---


### **🧠 Why TAO?**

ALPHA is built on the TAO network, a protocol purpose-built for decentralized AI.


## TAO provides:

* A scalable, secure P2P network for agents (miners) and validators
* A native reward system to incentivize useful, truthful outputs
* A Dynamic Subnet model that allows each use case (like ALPHA) to define its own agent logic, validation standards, and emissions


Instead of relying on centralized APIs or opaque inference services, ALPHA uses TAO to fund and govern a global, open-source AI data layer.

### **✅ Why Yuma Consensus?**


At the heart of TAO is Yuma Consensus, a trustless scoring algorithm that enables verifiability without needing proofs or privileged hardware.


* Validators independently query miners and score their outputs
* Yuma builds a scoring matrix—how each validator rates each miner
* Consensus is reached on which miners are providing the most valuable data
* Rewards are distributed accordingly, on-chain

This approach:

* Prevents single points of failure or control
* Promotes data diversity and resilience
* Allows for multiple validators (with different trust models) to participate

Yuma turns data quality into a crypto-economic game—where accuracy, timeliness, and consistency are rewarded, and noise is ignored.


---


### **🧩 The Result: A Verifiable AI Stack**

Together, TAO + Yuma enable ALPHA to:

* Operate a global network of real-time agents
* Deliver continuously improving, trust-minimized data
* Function as a plug-and-play oracle layer for financial infrastructure

ALPHA proves where that data came from, how it was sourced, and who validated it—at every step.


- AI provides intelligence.
- TAO provides integrity.
- ALPHA brings both on-chain.

## **🪙 Tokenomics (TAO Subnet)**

ALPHA is powered by TAO via the Dynamic Subnet System:



* Agents and validators are rewarded through TAO emissions

* TAO is staked into ALPHA’s reserve to mint ALPHA tokens

* Reward allocation:

    * 41% → Miners (agents)

    * 41% → Validators (and their stakers)

    * 18% → Subnet owner

Emissions and subnet funding are governed entirely on-chain.


---


## **🧩 Architecture Overview**


* Pipeline:

 External Sources → Agent Fetch → Validator Score → On-Chain Output

* Extensibility:

 Agents and validators use the MCP standard for plug-in logic

 Miners can add data from new geos, exchanges, chains, or APIs

* Transparency:

 All agent outputs are timestamped and publicly queryable

 Score matrices are persisted and auditable on Subtensor



---


## **🧭 Roadmap**



* 🔄 Live: BTC corporate treasury holdings index (private)
* 🔄 In progress: Final testing of UI interface
* 🔄 In progress: Codebase release
* 🔌 Coming: Extensible agents with MCP integration for cross-market data (Japan, AUS, etc.)

* 🧪 Coming: Verifiable agent inference (zkML + TEE pilots)



---


## 🧑‍💻 How to Contribute

* 🔄 Run a Miner: Add a data source or run an existing agent
* 🔄 Run a Validator: Score agent outputs and serve the network
* Stake TAO: Back ALPHA validators and earn part of emissions
* Extend the Network: Propose new tasks or build custom MCP modules

ALPHA is where decentralized AI meets financial truth.

Don’t trust the numbers. Verify them.
